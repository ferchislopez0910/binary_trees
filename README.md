# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

### General
- What is a binary tree
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

###### Types:
* __syntax__ 
Errors where we forget some (comma, colon, etc), the interpreter indicates you with an arrow that the error is in a certain file and close to that line..

* __Except__
An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that interrupts the normal flow of program instructions. In general, when a Python script encounters a situation that it cannot deal with, it generates an exception. An exception is a Python object that represents an error.
